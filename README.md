# Not-So-Generic-Chatbot
### This is the project under Project X - 2024
## Description
Traditional LLMs have a limited Scope and their outputs just depend on the data it is originally trained on. If a user asks a query, the response of which depends on a specific chunk of information which might not be related to the general data llms are trained on then the output obtained is not reliable and may lead to false decisions. RAG is a great way to overcome this issue, also it is comparitively efficient than other techniques like fine-tuning. Due to the dawn of Multimodal LLMs, the limited scope of RAGs to utilise only text documents is expanding to include other media like images. In this project we aim to develop a topic specific chatbot that will havev additional context, using MultiModal RAG.It will be able to take text and image inputs and give reliable output based on the extra data it will be fed.
